                              Companies at CES 2022 especially highlighted robots, ranging from a robot carrying objects and helping household chores, a robot designed for guide and delivery to a robot picking up and packaging apples from smart farms. Commonly, the companies highlighted user-oriented life companion robots. Then, why did these companies introduce robots as the future industry, along with clean technology, health care and space technology at CES, which is full of the latest IT innovations.<br><br>
                              The global economy has entered a slowdown since the pandemic and societies are now faced with many changes. Surging demand for non-face-to-face service has given rise to the spread of automation and robotics in the manufacturing and service sector. In addition, increase of single-person households, dual-income households and the elderly population as well as declining birthrate will hugely affect the robot demand.<br><br> 
                              The robot industry is gaining momentum as relevant technologies including AI, autonomous driving, battery and sensor are making a rapid progress. In line with the trend, companies have reached a conclusion that robots will not remain simple means of convenience but have a potential to be a companion for humans. Furthermore, robots are said to play a pivotal role connecting the real world with the virtual world.

                          Industrial robots are still dominating the robot market. Companies are deploying industrial robots proactively to address labor shortages and improve productivity. The outlook of industrial robot is promising both in domestic and oversea markets. A report released by the International Federation of Robotics (IFR) found a rapid growth of the global robot market. And the industrial robot market is expected to show the upward trend up until 2024 across the globe.<br><br>
                          Different industrial robots including vertical · horizontal polyarticular robot, parallel robot and gantry robot are currently available in the markets. The robots are used to address on-site challenges and improve laborers’ convenience. Among them, ‘Stretch’ and ‘Spot’ of Boston Dynamics acquired by Hyundai Motor are gaining the most attention.<br><br>                         
                          Stretch is an autonomous mobile robot targeting the global logistic market. The robot is built to maneuver in and out of tight spaces such as trucks and containers. Stretch specifically designed to automate warehouses can move 800 boxes in an hour and handle cases up to 23kg.<br><br>
                          Spot is a nimble four-legged robot that can climb stairs and navigate rough terrain with ease. The robot moves like a dog and also dances to BTS songs, making people pleasant. While the robot can be your companion like family and friend, it will be also used as an industrial robot by detecting risks on site and ensuring safety of laborers.

                        A service robot is said to have a great potential as it is growing its presence in the market. Life companion robot is in the spotlight once again due to a rapid growth of service robot market. Companion robot refers to a robot designed to interact and be in company with users. Companion robots have appeared as assistants or partners in Sci-fi films. These cases are also found in reality.<br><br>
                        Sony Electronics in Japan launched Aibo, a robot dog. Companion robot dog was a huge success in 2006 with 150,000 units of Aibo sold across the country. However, users ended up hosting mass funerals for their companion robots as they could not keep the robots after sales and customer service suspended. Aibo meant much more to the users and this case in point demonstrates the potential of companion robot market.<br><br>
                        Indeed, companion robots have not garnered much attention for 10 years since then even though many companies launched numerous companion robots. However, today, the commercialization of robot market is at crossroads again as several research centers and companies are taking steps.<br><br>
                        Recently, the German Marcs Planck Institute developed HuggieBot 3.0, an interactive hugging robot. When soft and warm HuggieBot detects a user, it opens its arms. The robot adjusts the height of its arms to give a perfect hug to users. It also detects when the user wants to move away and adapts quickly. The robot equipped with various features to give a perfect hug performs a different gesture including tapping on the user’s back and tightening its hold. For those who feel disconnected in social relationship with others, the companion robot can be a great comfort.

                        Companies that have reassessed the potential of companion robot market are struggling to move ahead. What do you think if companion robots that can mimic physical movement work and play with us together? Boston Dynamics’ Atlas and Tesla’s Tesla Bot are said to be the most promising humanoid robots.<br><br>
                        Atlas is a humanoid robot designed for search and rescue operations so the robot can maneuvers its way through complex parkour courses by hopping and doing backflips. In the past, humanoid robot was no more than an eye-catching innovation due to its limited movements and possibilities. On the other hand, today, Atlas has proved its surprisingly advanced gymnastic skills and performance, pushing beyond its limits.<br><br>
                        Tesla announced it will unveil a humanoid robot next year. There are dividing opinions over Elon Musk’s push for a new robot business. Some say the business does not make sense as it cannot make profits in the short-term while others say this is not a far-fetched dream as the humanoid robot technology has been already introduced in the past. Meanwhile, Elon Musk showed strong confidence that Tesla Bot will be able to perform hazardous tasks instead of humans and protect humans from danger.<br><br>
                        Of course, a humanoid robot helping household chores seems to be a thing in a far distant future. However, the Samsung Bot I and the Samsung Bot Handy, Samsung Electronics’ companion robots, are likely to be available in the near future.<br><br>
                        Recently, Samsung Electronics dived into robot business by launching companion robots for user convenience. The Samsung Bot I, an interactive robot, follows a user and be ready to help out. It also uses telepresence to assist the user without spatial limitations. The Samsung Bot Handy, a household assistant robot, prepares for virtual meetings and puts dishes on a table for dinner, which is called tableware handling, based on more advanced manipulation technology.

                          Battery is essential to power cordless products in the 4th Industrial Revolution. That is why battery is described as a basis of the future industry. Robots should run 24 hours while not plugged in. Therefore, a battery which stores energy is essential for robots to run for a long time.<br><br>
                          Residential robots including companion robots will be relatively smaller in size, compared to industrial robots. The size and type of robots are varying, depending on purposes. Therefore, the size and type of battery should change accordingly. For instance, soft robot that minimizes damage caused by collision and wearable robots for the elderly with mobility issues would require more flexible and soft energy storage device.<br><br>
                          Think of if a rescue robot in operation is out of charge. If the robot stops its operation at a critical moment, things will get worse. At the same time, rescue robots and underwater robots that go into deep water for marine research work under constrained and harsh conditions. So, smart battery equipped with artificial intelligence is necessary to manage and control battery performance, lifetime and safety by itself. The battery industry keeps pushing for innovation in battery development not only to ensure profitability and versatility but also to address difficulties in our lives.

                          The introduction of robots in combination with artificial intelligence is expected to improve task productivity and solve labor shortage caused by aging population. Many companies keep developing industrial and service robots that assist users and bring psychological comfort to users in real life.<br><br>
                          It is still difficult to find service robots except robot vacuums in our daily life. When do you expect companion robots including communication robot, educational robot and entertainment robot move packages, do dishes and clean, instead of us? If that becomes a reality, what will we have to do for co-existence with robots?<br><br>
                          Putting aside technical aspects, people are increasingly calling for in-depth discussing on living with robots. For instance, if companion robots have the equivalent right with companion animals, if added value created by robots is subject to tax and how to deal with unprecedented legal affairs related to robots should be discussed from now on.<br><br>
                          What we have to remember is robots in combination with new technologies can protect people from risks and offer convenience, ensuring quality of life. It is obvious that companion robots will create new lifestyle in the near future.<br><br>
                          However, developing robots in a right direction depends on us, humans. The time has come sooner than expected to ask the fundamental question on the existence of robots and come up with solutions. Perhaps, in the near future, you may have to buy your parents a robot, instead of home appliances.
