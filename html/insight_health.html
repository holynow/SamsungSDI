                        You may have heard of telemedicine which benefited from social distancing and self-quarantine. Telemedicine refers to direct provision of medical services to patients using video, phone and messaging.
                        <br><br>The biggest advantage of telemedicine is increased access to medical services. For those who have difficulties finding time to go to hospitals due to busy schedule and live at a distance with poor transportation as well as the elderly and the disabled with mobility issues, telemedicine is essential to address healthcare inequality. 
                        <br><br>What’s more, the metaverse is rapidly gaining traction in the healthcare industry. In an immersive environment using AR and VR, a variety of medical practices including clinical trials and training programs can be simulated.

                          Digital therapeutics are gaining attention as much as telemedicine in the digital healthcare industry. Digital therapeutics refer to evidence-based therapeutic interventions driven by software to prevent and treat medical disorders or diseases. For instance, a doctor prescribes an application to download according to a disease that a patient suffers.
                          <br><br>Game is frequently mentioned as a keyword in the digital therapeutics market. Therapeutic games help increase accessibility to digital therapeutics for those who hesitate to opt for digital therapeutics. In the U.S., game-based digital therapeutics have turned out to be statistically effective in treating drug or alcohol addiction. 
                          <br><br>In addition, many other digital therapeutics are being developed, including meditation for depression and insomnia and VR therapeutic program for PTSD. Relumino, presented by Samsung Electronics, is the case in point. Relumino, which means light up again, is a visual aid app developed for people with vision issues such as refractive disorder or high myopia. Currently, glass-type vision aid device equipped with Relumino technology is in development. Once it becomes commercialized, people with low vision will be able to watch movies and read books with ease. 
                          <br><br>As such, digital therapeutics have completely changed the scope of therapeutics that had been done physically and chemically. If digital therapeutics become common in the future and can be easily accessible, disease treatment will not be considered so seriously.

                          There are some digital healthcare technologies emerging recently, including telemedicine and digital therapeutics. But, the healthcare trend originally started with wearable devices. Let’s learn about wearable robot, Power Suit. The labor-intensive logistics industry especially has focused on Power Suit. The wearable robot improves productivity significantly by reducing pressure on workers who carry heavy packages at sites. Accordingly, the industry is deploying Power Suit to reduce labor intensity and injury risks one after another. 
                        <br><br>Samsung Electronics, which has focused on development of wearable robots including Power Suit, is about to launch walking assist robot, GEMS HIP. GEMS HIP, first presented at CES 2019, is wearable robot to support walking and physical strength, allowing users to walk more stable and more efficient. The robot is known to increase strength and walking speed by 24% and 14%, respectively. Wearable robots can be utilized not only for industrial purposes but also for medical purposes by providing support for the elderly and patients with mobility issues. 
                        <br><br>Indeed, smartwatch on your wrist is the most common wearable healthcare device. Smartwatch and smart bands are equipped with health tracking features using accelerometer, gyroscope and ECG sensor. They can detect subtle changes in users’ body and monitor step, heart rate, blood pressure and physical movement. There are cases where a disease was found in early stage thanks to low oxygen alert and geographic information was automatically sent to a rescue team after fall detection so that the user could save the life. These wearable devices look like simple accessory, but are essentially equipped with life-saving features.

                          In line with the growing demands for wearable devices which can be applied for healthcare and other applications, many businesses have introduced a wide range of wearable devices. With a wide range of choices, consumers are taking account into different aspects in purchasing wearable devices. It is natural for consumers to prefer smaller and lighter wearable devices but with high performance and high capacity. 
                          <br><br>The battery industry has developed its technology in line with the evolution of wearable device. However, it was not easy for the battery industry to catch up with the speed of developing wearable devices due to their complex but flexible design as well as high power. Still, the battery industry have committed to realizing advanced performance and capacity in smaller and lighter batteries.
                          <br><br>One of core technologies that the battery industry is developing is flexible battery. As the name says, flexible batteries can be customized to meet customers’ needs and take up smaller space than lithium-ion batteries, dramatically reducing the weight of devices. In other words, flexible batteries can contribute to creating a new form factor for smartphone, notebook computer and TV as well as wearable device. 
                          <br><br>As solid-state batteries, called dream batteries, are gaining traction, there is growing expectation on flexible batteries. Flexible batteries are drawing attention across the industry as development of solid-state batteries are likely to create the best conditions to develop flexible batteries.
                          <br><br>Given batteries for wearable devices will continue to be in development, the digital healthcare industry which is closely linked to wearable devices is going to expand further.
