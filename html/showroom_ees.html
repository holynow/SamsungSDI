                          The Smarter E 2022 was completely different from last year. In 2020, the event was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Smarter E 2021 took place in October, 2021 after being delayed and its scale was only one third of the previous event. However, this year, it seemed everything had returned to pre-pandemic levels.

                        Furthermore, various solutions for utility/residential applications were also presented to meet different customer needs, in line with EU’s aggressive energy policies. Fossil fuel will replace with renewable energy in sectors which demand greater energy, including heating and cooling. The existing centralized grid is being reshaped into distributed grid using renewable energy. Moreover, energy storage systems are increasingly installed in regions where renewable energy is produced and consumed so that additional costs for setting up transmission and distribution network is no longer needed.

                        As for the utility market, the box-type solution turned out to be the mainstream given major suppliers have increasingly displayed and promoted the concept and relevant products at the exhibition. Most of the products are equipped with LFP cells so the competition against Samsung SDI’s NCM cells is expected to continue. Major suppliers have also put an emphasis on efficient thermal management using liquid cooling system, highlighting life improvement and OPEX saving.

                        In Europe, the residential ESS takes up a large proportion of the ESS market. Therefore, electricity price increases and subsidies for solar panels have encouraged economical energy consumption and sales. In response, many companies have showcased residential ESS products. Samsung SDI has also introduced its residential product, R5. The R5 equipped with 5.0Ah cylindrical batteries ensures high capacity and high efficiency so it is highly recognized in the industry. Various configurations are available to meet different customers’ needs, allowing easy installation for flexible capacities.
