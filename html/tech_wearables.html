                         Small batteries were used for the conventional wired devices, allowing us to overcome physical constraints. Devices that are used to be powered by fossil fuel have been replaced with battery-powered devices. Today, small batteries are at the center of the battery market, reflecting greater interest in green technology. With the advent of the Battery of Things (BoT), where everything is powered by batteries, small batteries will be used for various applications, including power tools, e-bikes and robots. 
                         <br><br>
                         In response, Samsung SDI has increased the energy density of pouch cells for IT devices to extend the usage time and raised the capacity of cylindrical batteries to use them for various types of e-mobility, including e-bikes.
