Touted as dream batteries, solid-state batteries are said to ensure higher energy density and safety than lithium-ion batteries (LiBs). Let’s take a look at Samsung SDI’s effort to advance solid-state batteries. </p>

                          Solid-state batteries, known as the next generation batteries are also touted as dream batteries. As solid-state batteries are highly recognized for advanced safety and performance, they are likely to replace lithium-ion batteries.<br><br>
                          Samsung SDI at the forefront of solid-state battery technology has jointly developed solid-state batteries for EVs with the Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology (SAIT) and Samsung R&D Institute Japan.

                          Solid-state batteries can ensure higher safety than the conventional lithium-ion batteries as they use liquid electrolytes, not solid electrolytes. At the same time, the energy density of solid-state batteries increases significantly by using lithium for their anodes, instead of graphite.<br><br>
                          However, this is not to say that solid-state batteries are completely perfect. Lithium dendrite is a roadblock in the realization of solid-state batteries. Dendrites are branch-shaped crystals accumulating on the anode surface during charging. Dendrites disturb the movement of lithium, creating risks to degrade battery performance and damage separators. As a result, life cycle and safety of batteries can be negatively affected.<br><br>
                          In 2020, Samsung SDI published its in-depth study on dendrites in the ‘Nature Energy’, the global scientific journal and attracted a huge attention across the industry. 
                          <br><br>
                          Samsung SDI succeeded to improve safety, life cycle and energy density of solid-state batteries by applying a thin Ag-C nanocomposite layer in an effort to address issues that can occur when using lithium for their anodes, instead of graphite.

                         Samsung SDI is focusing on sulfide electrolytes, which are known to improve life cycle and energy density of solid-state batteries. In addition, it has also unveiled an ambitious roadmap for the next generation battery, with an aim to start mass-production in 2027.<br><br>
                          Samsung SDI recently broke ground to set up a pilot line (S-Line) for solid-state batteries at the Samsung SDI R&D Center located in Suwon. The pilot line takes up about 6,500㎡ (2,000 pyeong) and will be composed of the latest facilities for manufacturing solid-state batteries. Samsung SDI plans to introduce facilities and system to produce cathode and solid electrolyte and adopt new production method and infrastructure such as assembling cells to allow ions to move smoothly within.

                        <p class="txt w1000">Samsung SDI is already capable of producing solid-state batteries in small scale. However, the mass-production of solid-state batteries is another story. In that sense, Samsung SDI’s move to build a pilot line for solid-state batteries demonstrates its strong will to commercialize the batteries based on its R&D achievement. Samsung SDI looks forward to seeing a new era where its unrivalled solid-state battery technology enables EVs to drive 900km on a single charge.</p>
