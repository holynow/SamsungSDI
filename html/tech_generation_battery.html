Samsung SDI has launched ‘Gen.5’, the fifth generation battery, dreaming of EVs that run farther and longer. </p>

                         The global EV sales are expected to reach 50 million in 2030. This demonstrates EVs are becoming part of our lives. However, the auto industry finds much room for improvement in EVs. Driving range is the case in point.<br><br>
                          Internal combustion vehicles, which are the biggest EV competitors, can drive about 600km while electric vehicles can drive about 300km on average on a single charge. Therefore, battery manufacturers are committed to increasing battery capacity to extend the electric range while reducing charging time. Many battery manufacturers are working on advancing battery materials, which play key roles in extending driving range. Through relentless effort to advance battery materials, Samsung SDI has introduced Gen.5 batteries to take the leadership in the EV battery market.

                          Samsung SDI’s battery development stems from Gen.1, its first generation battery. Electrodes coated with active materials and separators were winded as a jelly roll before being inserted into Gen. 1 batteries. Later, Gen.2 and Gen. 3 batteries using the winding method were used for PHEV models of Volkswagen, Audi and BMW.<br><br>
                          From Gen.4 batteries, the stacking method was newly applied to prevent swelling which can damage materials during charging and discharging. When electrodes are winded as a jelly roll and inserted into batteries, much room at the edge of prismatic can are left empty. It is like we cannot completely fill a prismatic case with jelly roll-shaped toilet paper.

                        <p class="txt w1000">The problem is that the empty space increases risks of swelling. When a battery cell swells significantly, there would be higher risks of fire. To mitigate the risks of swelling, Samsung SDI decided to use the stacking method to make the most of the internal space. <br><br>
                          The stacking method was applied for Gen.4 batteries. Samsung SDI started to change materials to increase the battery capacity of Gen.4 batteries. Gen. 4 batteries used NCA for their cathodes, instead of NCM. High capacity Gen. 4 batteries extended driving range of electric vehicles but Samsung SDI did not satisfy with this as Gen. 4 batteries were only used for PHEVs, not EVs.

                          To keep up with the current EV trend, Samsung SDI has launched Gen.5 EV batteries. Gen.5 batteries have been recognized as the best-ever EV batteries. The achievement was possible thanks to Samsung SDI’s innovative materials technology and manufacturing process, including smart factories and stacking process.<br><br>
                          As aluminum and advanced coating technology were applied, Samsung SDI has realized higher capacity in Gen.5 batteries and improved driving range and safety while minimizing battery degradation. As a result, Samsung SDI has raised the nickel share to 88% and increased the energy density by 20%, saving the materials cost by 20% at the same time. <br><br>
                          Samsung SDI has launched flat type Gen.5 batteries for low-height vehicles for the first time. The flat batteries have the minimum height among prismatic batteries. Besides flat batteries, Samsung SDI is able to provide customized batteries based on customers’ needs. As they guarantee industry-leading performance and also can be customized for customers’ needs, the EV battery industry is eyeing on Gen.5 batteries.
